# Map_Route_Search_Algorithm
Finding the fastest route from one location to another using different search alogirhtms, and visually show the differences between each search alogirthm.

OSM Pathfinding with Python
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project parses OpenStreetMap (.osm) data into a graph structure and runs search algorithms (like DFS, BFS, Greedy, Dijkstra, A*) to find paths between points.
The graph is built from ways and nodes:

Ways = roads (e.g., "Cleveland Avenue")

Nodes = points along those roads (lat/lon coordinates)

Supports handling oneway streets, intersections, and exporting results to GPX so they can be visualized in JOSM or other map editors.

âš¡ Features

Parse .osm XML files into a Python graph.

Build adjacency lists from <way> and <nd> references.

Support for oneway=yes / no / -1 and defaults.

Run BFS (and extendable to A*, Dijkstra, etc.) for pathfinding.

Export results as GPX tracks for visualization in JOSM.
